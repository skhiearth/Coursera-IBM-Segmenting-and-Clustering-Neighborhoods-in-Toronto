# Coursera-IBM-Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto
Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. This project is a part of the Data Science Specialisation Capstone offered by IBM on Coursera.

In this project, we convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values and use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto. 
Using, the explore function we get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. 
Finally, the Folium library is used to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto and their emerging clusters.
