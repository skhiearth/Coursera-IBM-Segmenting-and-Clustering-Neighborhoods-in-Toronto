# Coursera-IBM-Visualizing-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto
Visualizing Neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. This project is a part of the Data Science Specialisation Capstone offered by IBM on Coursera.

In this project, we scrape the WikiPedia page listing the ZIP codes in the region of Toronto in Canada. We then convert this data to a Pandas DF and clean the data. Adresses are converted into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Lastly, the Folium library is used to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto.
